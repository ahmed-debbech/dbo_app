# Dragon Ball Online Global Event Notifier App

This is an android application for DBOG players (their official website: https://dboglobal.to/).

# What is it?
This is a notifier app about the running & upcomming events in the game, notably: Adult Solo budokai, Adult Kid budokai, etc... \

# Now, what is it Technically?
It is a flutter app tested on android devices connected to a backend that does all the work [You can find it here](https://github.com/ahmed-debbech/dbo_event_notifier). \
This app is basically just a presenter for data comming from the backend application.

# What does it do?:
* It shows you the closest events events.
* It shows you the world boss progress.
* It pushes notifications to you when an event is started or world boss has been reached.

# How can i get ?
Until now i still don't own a Google developer account, so it is not on store yet.
But you still can get the apk directly from github in the release section.

# Is it beautiful ? How does it look like?


### Do you have any suggestions? please tell me. ðŸ˜‰
